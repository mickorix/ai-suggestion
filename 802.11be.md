Support for Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be) in open-source firmware is currently in its early stages. While support exists, it is largely determined by which router you own (or plan to buy), as driver availability for the new chips is the main bottleneck.

The following is a breakdown of the current status for the major open-source projects.

### 1. Asuswrt-Merlin (Best Current Support)

This is currently the most stable and feature-complete option for Wi-Fi 7. Because Merlin builds on top of the official Asus code, it retains the proprietary drivers required for Wi-Fi 7 to work correctly while adding open-source features.

* **Status:** **Stable / Production Ready.**
* **Supported Routers:** Most ASUS "BE" series routers.
* **RT-BE96U**
* **RT-BE88U**
* **GT-BE98**
* **RT-BE58U**


* **Why choose this:** If you want Wi-Fi 7 speeds *now* with the stability of stock firmware but the features of open-source (VPN scripts, adblocking, DNS control).

### 2. OpenWrt (Initial Support)

OpenWrt officially added initial Wi-Fi 7 support in the **24.10 stable release** (October 2024). However, "initial support" means it is still experimental for many devices, and the list of fully supported hardware is short compared to Wi-Fi 6.

* **Status:** **Stable (Release 24.10), but hardware selection is limited.**
* **Key Challenge:** OpenWrt relies on open-source drivers (like `mt76` for MediaTek or `ath12k` for Qualcomm). Broadcom-based Wi-Fi 7 routers are generally **not supported** because Broadcom does not release open-source Wi-Fi drivers.
* **Hardware to look for:**
* **MediaTek Filogic 880 devices:** This chipset currently has the best mainline Linux support.
* **Qualcomm Immersive Home devices:** Support is improving via the `ath12k` driver.
* **Specific Models:** Banana Pi BPI-R4 (a popular board for DIY router builds) is a flagship for OpenWrt Wi-Fi 7 development.



### 3. GL.iNet Firmware (OpenWrt-Based)

GL.iNet manufactures routers that ship with a customized version of OpenWrt out of the box. They have released native Wi-Fi 7 routers that are fully supported.

* **Status:** **Production Ready.**
* **Supported Routers:**
* **Flint 2 (GL-MT6000):** *Note: This is technically Wi-Fi 6, but their newer "BE" models are rolling out.*
* **Slate 7 (GL-BE3600):** A travel router with full Wi-Fi 7 support.
* **Flint 3 (GL-BE9300):** Their upcoming high-performance home router.


* **Why choose this:** This is the easiest way to get an OpenWrt-based Wi-Fi 7 router without having to flash firmware yourself or worry about driver incompatibility.

### 4. DD-WRT & FreshTomato

* **DD-WRT:** Support is "Work in Progress." You may find beta builds for specific Broadcom-based Wi-Fi 7 routers, but they often use hybrid proprietary drivers that can be unstable or lack full 802.11be feature sets (like MLO - Multi-Link Operation).
* **FreshTomato:** **No support yet.** FreshTomato focuses heavily on older Broadcom (Wi-Fi 5/6) hardware. It usually takes a long time for this project to adopt new generations due to its reliance on specific Broadcom SDKs.

### Summary Recommendation

| If you want... | Get this Firmware | Hardware Suggestion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Stability & Speed** | **Asuswrt-Merlin** | Asus RT-BE96U or RT-BE88U |
| **Pure Open Source** | **OpenWrt (24.10+)** | Banana Pi BPI-R4 or wait for more Filogic 880 devices |
| **Pre-installed OpenWrt** | **GL.iNet Stock** | GL.iNet Slate 7 (GL-BE3600) |

For the "best Wi-Fi experience" with an iPhone 17, you need a router that excels in **Multi-Link Operation (MLO)**. This is the killer feature of Wi-Fi 7 that allows your iPhone to connect to two bands (e.g., 5GHz + 6GHz) simultaneously, drastically reducing latency and preventing jitter.

**Important iPhone 17 Context:**
According to technical specs and leaks, the iPhone 17's Wi-Fi chip (likely the Apple N1) is capped at **160 MHz bandwidth**, meaning it does *not* support the theoretical 320 MHz max of Wi-Fi 7.

* **What this means for you:** Don't obsess over "Max Throughput" marketing numbers (like BE19000 or BE33000). You won't hit those peaks.
* **Focus on this instead:** **Latency and MLO stability.** This is where a high-quality open-source router shines.

Here are the two best paths for an open-source Wi-Fi 7 setup in late 2025.

### 1. The "Performance King" (Best Wi-Fi Experience)

**Hardware:** **ASUS RT-BE96U** or **GT-BE98 Pro**
**Firmware:** **Asuswrt-Merlin**

This is the best choice if your priority is the actual Wi-Fi connection quality for your iPhone.

* **Why it wins:** Wi-Fi 7 relies on complex proprietary drivers for features like MLO and Beamforming. Pure OpenWrt often struggles to reverse-engineer these perfectly on day one. Asuswrt-Merlin builds on top of the official Asus code (keeping the perfect drivers) but adds the open-source layer (VPNs, scripts, DNS control, ad-blocking) you want.
* **The Experience:** You get seamless roaming and working MLO (essential for the iPhone 17).
* **Pros:**
* **MLO works out of the box:** Critical for iPhone 17 to switch bands instantly without lag.
* **Hybrid Power:** You get the stability of stock firmware with the power of Entware/scripts.
* **10Gb Ports:** Future-proofs your wired network too.



### 2. The "Pure Open Source" (Best Turnkey OpenWrt)

**Hardware:** **GL.iNet Flint 3 (GL-BE9300)**
**Firmware:** **OpenWrt (Native)**

If you want a router that runs true OpenWrt out of the box without needing to flash it yourself, this is the flagship choice.

* **Why it wins:** It is built *for* OpenWrt. You don't void your warranty flashing it. It uses the Qualcomm IPQ chipset which has better open-source driver support than Broadcom.
* **The Experience:** It supports Wi-Fi 7 and MLO, but you might need to tweak settings in the LuCI interface to optimize it for Apple devices (e.g., enabling 802.11k/v/r for roaming).
* **Pros:**
* **Native OpenWrt:** No hacking required; full root access immediately.
* **4x 2.5G Ports:** Excellent for high-speed wired backhaul.
* **AdGuard Home:** Comes pre-installed for network-wide ad blocking on your iPhone.


* **Caveat:** Early benchmarks suggest its VPN encryption speeds (WireGuard) might be slightly lower than expected for the hardware, though still very fast.

### 3. The "DIY" Option (For Experts)

**Hardware:** **Banana Pi BPI-R4**
**Firmware:** **OpenWrt 24.10+ (Mainline)**

If you want to build a router that rivals commercial gear for a fraction of the price and have total control:

* **The Build:** Use the BPI-R4 board (MediaTek Filogic 880) with a Wi-Fi 7 Network Interface Card (NIC).
* **Why:** The Filogic 880 is currently the "golden child" of OpenWrt development. It has the best mainline Linux support for Wi-Fi 7.
* **Warning:** This requires assembly and command-line configuration. It is not "plug and play."

### Summary Recommendation

| Priority | Get this Device | Why for iPhone 17? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **I want the best connection possible** | **Asus RT-BE96U** (w/ Merlin) | The drivers handle the iPhone's MLO handshake perfectly, ensuring zero-lag switching between 5GHz and 6GHz. |
| **I want 100% Open Source** | **GL.iNet Flint 3** | Runs OpenWrt natively. Good Wi-Fi 7 support without the headache of flashing unsupported hardware. |

If you want a true "security control environment," an all-in-one consumer router (even with open-source firmware) is often the bottleneck. Running heavy security tasks—like deep packet inspection, intrusion detection, or granular VLAN routing—requires more processing power than most router chips can handle without slowing down your Wi-Fi 7 speeds.

For the best security without sacrificing your iPhone 17's performance, I recommend a **Split Network Architecture**.

### The "Ultimate Security" Setup (Split Architecture)

This approach separates the "Brain" (Security) from the "Radio" (Wi-Fi). This is the gold standard for home security.

**1. The Brain: Mini PC with OPNsense**
Instead of a standard router, you use a Mini PC (like a device with an Intel N100 or N305 processor) running **OPNsense**.

* **What it is:** OPNsense is a hardened, open-source firewall operating system (based on FreeBSD).
* **Why it's better:**
* **Intrusion Detection (IDS/IPS):** You can run tools like **Suricata** or **Zenarmor** to inspect every packet entering your network for malware and attacks. Standard routers cannot do this at gigabit speeds.
* **CrowdSec:** You can block IP addresses that are currently attacking other users worldwide.
* **VLANs:** You can easily isolate your network. For example, put your IoT devices (fridge, smart lights) on a separate "Dirty" VLAN so they cannot access your iPhone 17 or laptop.



**2. The Radio: Wi-Fi 7 Access Point**
You connect a Wi-Fi 7 device solely to handle the wireless signal.

* **Recommendation:** **GL.iNet Flint 3 (GL-BE9300)** in **Access Point (AP) Mode**.
* **Why:** Since you want open-source, the Flint 3 allows you to run OpenWrt for the Wi-Fi layer. It handles the Multi-Link Operation (MLO) for your iPhone 17, while the OPNsense box handles the security.

### The "All-in-One" Alternative (If you only want one device)

If you prefer a single device but still want maximum control, the **Banana Pi BPI-R4** is currently the only open-source board powerful enough to act as a serious security gateway *and* a Wi-Fi 7 router simultaneously.

* **Hardware:** Banana Pi BPI-R4 (MediaTek Filogic 880).
* **Firmware:** OpenWrt (Snapshot/Mainline).
* **Security Capability:**
* It has a **Quad-core ARM Cortex-A73** processor, which is powerful enough to run Docker containers.
* You can run **AdGuard Home** (network-wide ad/tracker blocking) directly on the router.
* You can set up strict **nftables** firewall rules and VLAN segmentation.


* **Pros:** Total control, 10Gb SFP+ ports, fully open-source hardware and software.
* **Cons:** Requires assembly (adding the Wi-Fi 7 NIC card) and command-line configuration.

### Summary Comparison

| Feature | **Split Architecture** (OPNsense + AP) | **All-in-One DIY** (Banana Pi BPI-R4) | **Consumer Mod** (Asuswrt-Merlin) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Security Depth** | **High** (Deep Packet Inspection, Zenarmor) | **Medium-High** (AdGuard, Firewall) | **Medium** (Skynet, IP Blocking) |
| **Wi-Fi 7 Speed** | **Max** (AP handles Wi-Fi only) | **High** (Drivers are good) | **Max** (Proprietary drivers) |
| **Complexity** | High (Requires learning OPNsense) | Very High (Requires Linux skills) | Low (Plug & Play) |
| **Best for...** | A true "Security Lab" environment | Hardcore Open Source enthusiasts | Gamers who want "set and forget" |

### My Recommendation for You

Since you have an iPhone 17 and value the "best experience," the **Split Architecture** is the superior choice.

1. Buy a fanless **Intel N100 Mini PC** with 4x 2.5G ports (~$150). Install **OPNsense**.
2. Buy the **GL.iNet Flint 3** (~$120-150). Set it to **AP Mode**.

This ensures your security layers (on the PC) never slow down your Wi-Fi latency (on the AP), giving your iPhone the snappy connection it needs.
