### **Travel Tips for Annecy & Beyond:**

1. **GVA to Annecy:** The easiest way is the **FlixBus** or **BlaBlaCar Bus** which runs directly from Geneva Airport to Annecy center in about an hour.  
2. **Annecy to Chamonix:** You can take a regional train or a bus. It is a very scenic route through the Arve Valley.  
3. **Safe Travels:** Since you are under 18, always keep a digital copy of your passport and flight tickets on your phone. Italy and France are very safe, but it's always good to be organized\!  
4. **The Mall Outlet:** When you go to The Mall, visit the "Welcome Desk" first; sometimes they have extra discount booklets for international students or visitors.
